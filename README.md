## Hello there

I'm Bryan, a **Software Engineer** based in Florian√≥polis (the Magic Island üèùÔ∏è) with a focus in backend and aiming to be a DevOps Engineer. I love to automate boring tasks and to refactor code. I **strive to make legible code**, with detailed documentation and easy to understand; a legible code is easier to maintain, fix and extend it (and with high level languages, the compiler does the hard work for us).

Furthermore, I have experience with the **full software development cycle**, from collecting features requirements, to implementing, testing and deploying it; automating all the process in between (CI/CD). Alongside this, I have experience dealing with customers, understanding their needs, translating them to new feature specifications, and also guiding them through troubleshooting methods.

I also have a **research background**, during my last year at the university, I was part of the Embedded Computing Lab (ECL) at UFSC, researching the Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP), which applies Machine Learning to the electronic design automation (EDA), specifically to the logic learning and optimization process of logic circuits. During this time, I had an [article](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-29573-7_10) accepted for the European conference EvoStar, which I presented online in 2023.

Below, are some of my main contribuitions to the open-source project [Apache CloudStack](https://cloudstack.apache.org/):
- [GUI whitelabel runtime system](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/8942)
- [Refactor of Allocator classes](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/9074)
- [KVM: Add support for cgroupv2](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/8252)
- [Add dynamic secondary storage selection](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7659)
- [Public IP quarantine feature](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7378)
